## Step 3: Re-pair the Keyboard

1. Turn on both halves by connecting them to power (or through their power switches if they have them)
2. The first time you power them on after the reset, they will automatically pair with each other
3. The LED on the controllers should indicate when they're paired (typically a specific pattern or color)

## Step 4: Connect to Your Computer

1. To put the keyboard in pairing mode, press the usual Bluetooth pairing key combination (according to the Miryoku layout)
2. On your computer, go to Bluetooth settings and look for the Totem keyboard
3. Select it to pair
4. You may need to enter a pairing code on the keyboard if prompted

## Troubleshooting

- If the halves don't pair with each other, try resetting both halves again
- If your computer doesn't detect the keyboard, make sure it's in pairing mode and try restarting your computer's Bluetooth
- If keys aren't working correctly, verify you flashed both halves with the correct firmware

These steps should help resolve issues related to accumulated settings or Bluetooth connectivity data that might be causing problems with the 'i' key or other functionality.
